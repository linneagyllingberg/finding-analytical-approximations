Code for the article "Finding analytical approximations for discrete, stochastic, individual-based models of ecology"

The file IBM.m contains the code for the indivudal based model. 

The files bifur_new_approx.m and bifur_approx_random_r.m produces bifurcatiobn plots for the local correlation approximations. 

prob_rd_sim.m contains code for extinction plots and tlqv_run.py has code to run the 4TLQV-statistical test from PySSaGE on the IBM data.
